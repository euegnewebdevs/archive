Web apps, mobile backends, microservices... Pretty much all web and mobile applications being built now have some sort of HTTP API involved. Not only is building an API accessible for all developer skill levels and languages, it can even be quite satisfying.

Antonio Ortega will present some basics for those who might be new to building an API, covering with some popular options such as Lumen (PHP), Flask (Python), Express (Node), WP API (Wordpress).

If you're an old hand already, come to share gotchas and horror stories (SOAP lives, omg) and just hang out.
