WebAssembly w/Go
===========

[Official Wiki](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/WebAssembly)

# Examples

## General
* [Shimmer](https://github.com/agnivade/shimmer) - Image transformation in wasm using Go

## Canvas (2D)
* [GoWasm Experiments](https://github.com/stdiopt/gowasm-experiments) - Demonstrates
  working code for several common call types
  * [bouncy](https://stdiopt.github.io/gowasm-experiments/bouncy)
  * [rainbow-mouse](https://stdiopt.github.io/gowasm-experiments/rainbow-mouse)
  * [repulsion](https://stdiopt.github.io/gowasm-experiments/repulsion)
  * [bumpy](https://stdiopt.github.io/gowasm-experiments/bumpy) - Uses the 2d canvas, and a 2d physics engine.  Click around on the screen to create objects then watch as gravity takes hold!
  * [arty](https://stdiopt.github.io/gowasm-experiments/arty/client)
* [Gomeboycolor-wasm](https://github.com/djhworld/gomeboycolor-wasm)
  * WASM port of an experimental Gameboy Color emulator.  The [matching blog post](https://djhworld.github.io/post/2018/09/21/i-ported-my-gameboy-color-emulator-to-webassembly/)
  contains some interesting technical insights.

## WebGL canvas (3D)
* [Rotating cube](https://bobcob7.github.io/wasm-rotating-cube/) / [source code](https://github.com/bobcob7/wasm-rotating-cube) - Creates a rotating cube in WebGL
* [Splashy](https://stdiopt.github.io/gowasm-experiments/splashy) / [source code](https://github.com/stdiopt/gowasm-experiments/tree/master/splashy) - Click around on the screen to generate paint...
